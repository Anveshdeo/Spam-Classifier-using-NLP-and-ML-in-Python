# Spam-Classifier-using-NLP-and-ML-in-Python
Today messages, reviews and opinions have become a significant source of information. In this era, Short message service or SMS is considered one of the most powerful means of communication. As the dependence on mobile devices has drastically increased over the period of time it has led to an increased number of attacks in the form of SMS Spam.

***Purpose***
The purpose of this project is to understand how we can implement NLP and ML to build SMS spam detection model. Particularly, we will build a binary classification model to detect whether a text message is spam or not (aka Ham).

***Result***
Trained with Naive Bayes which gave best accuracy of 98.47%.
